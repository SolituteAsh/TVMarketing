# TVMarketing
The project involves building a linear regression model to predict sales based on the TV marketing budget. The dataset contains 200 rows and 2 columns, with TV and Sales as the two columns. The project involves using machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means, and Regression algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees to build the model. Based on the nature of the dataset, Linear Regression is chosen as the appropriate approach to build the model. The project involves preparing X and y, training and testing the model, and evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ². A Python code is developed to build the model.
